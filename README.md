# Tech Requirements
    ❖ Strictly UIKit
    ❖ Programmatic UI
    ❖ RealmDB --
    ❖ Modularization and unit testing is a plus
    ❖ No Third Party Libraries (Aside RealmDB)

# Architecture
   The architecture of the project follows the principles of DRY and MVVM.

# What I could have done better in attempting this test
     Handle error messages properly with more contexts.
     Test end to end.
     Rather than userdefaults, realm could have been used , given more time.
     Code clean up(file arrangement, removing magic strings and print statement
     )
     A better user Interface.
